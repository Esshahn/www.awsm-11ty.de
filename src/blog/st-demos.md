![ST Demos](../../assets/img/blog/stdemos.jpg)

Looks at these beauties. This is actually my hand writing and I can still remember how I got all those discs for my Atari 1040 STE. I was always a sucker for great demos or cracktros, more than for the actual games.
All those disks worked by the way. Awesome.
