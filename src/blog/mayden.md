(well, almost…)

I wanted to create a nice Plus/4 version of the Mayden image I drew for the C64 “week in progress” demo by Mayday. I was unaware that the color restriction is different in one detail: instead of 1 background color plus 3 freely choosable ones (which the C64 works like), it is 2 background colors plus 2 freely choosable ones.

I think I have to give up on this one and need to keep this limitation in mind right from the start when doing artwork for the 264 series. Anyway, here’s the picture without the restriction.
