title: 'Scooter was a cracker!'
---

What if HP Baxxter, the band leader of Scooter, was doing (horrible) cracks on the C64 back in the days? For some unexplainable reason, dalezy and I went with the idea and did a prank on the scene. I created a little cracktro, true 80s vibe, with little clues hidden everywhere. Next I made a fake video. About a year later, it got discovered by the scene and eventually bugjam connected the dots and found out the truth. Quite a fun experience ðŸ˜€ 

Check out the <a href="http://csdb.dk/release/?id=152048">cracktro here</a> and make sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYCTfVU-kqE">watch the fake video</a>â€¦
