Another computer alive again: Amiga 500 with a HxC SD Floppy Emulator running Xenon II – Megablast.

I own two Amiga 500 now and both work, but somehow they are never very reliable when I try to run software from the HxC device. Maybe it’s just them and me knowing that we’re not meant for each other. After all, I was on the Atari ST side of the system flamewars.
