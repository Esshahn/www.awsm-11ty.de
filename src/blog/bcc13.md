The BCC#13 demo party is over and I’m still recovering from a great party with so many nice people and too many beers. Mayday contributed a new trackmo called “week in progress”, which scored 3rd place, beaten by the even better productions from Delysid and Atlantis. My entry for the graphics competition, “The White Rabbit”, did very well and scored 1st place, which makes me very happy.
