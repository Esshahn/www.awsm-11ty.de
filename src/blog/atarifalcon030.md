I still remember very vividly how much I wanted an Atari Falcon back in the 90s. My Atari STE finally lost the battle against the Amiga in terms of games and popularity and this machine was the last attempt of a home computer to rise up against the Borg army of the PC compatibles. Of course we all know how this ended, but back then, the Atari Falcon 030 was the most amazing piece of hardware you could possibly own.

I bought this one on eBay in 2010. It was already quite rare and with around 100 Euros it wasnâ€™t exactly a bargain (at that time a C64 set sold for less than 10 Euros mostly). A Falcon in good condition sells for 400 Euros and above as of today in 2017.
