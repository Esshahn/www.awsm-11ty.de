I just learned that the “4Sceners” special on 4players awarded my browser demo “My God, it’s full of Sinus!” in two categories:

* 5th place in category browser demo
* 4th place in category newcomer

That’s amazing, thank you very much!
Check out the other fantastic demos too: <a href="http://www.4players.de/4players.php/dispbericht/Spielkultur/Special/7020/81601/0/4Sceners.html">4players</a>
