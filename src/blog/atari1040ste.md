I have to admit that this is an STE I got from eBay and not the computer I bought in 1989. My Atari was broken one day and I brought it to the repair shop in the neighbor town. Strangely enough I never picked it up again. Hard to understand now. Anyway, this one was pretty cheap (probably cheaper than the repair my old one would have cost me) and came upgraded to 4MB â€“ neat.
